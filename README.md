# blog-with-database
Simple blog made with JavaScript and MySQL
(Comments are a bit buggy for now but they are still working)

## How to start the server
* You have to run npm install in the folder (with the console) you extracted the files in order for the blog to run
* After npm install you start the server with going into the bin file and write node www in the console again
* You also have to create a database (MySQL) with name "blog" so it can save the data

## Create an user and an article
Just like every website with users you have to create a user and log into with so you can create articles and add comments. Simple as that.
